Title: Bootstrapped Confidence Intervals for (Negative) Likelihood Ratio Tests
Version: 1.0

Author: Keith A. Marill and Ari B. Friedman

Description: This package computes appropriate confidence intervals for the likelihood ratio tests commonly used in medicine/epidemiology.  It is particularly useful when the sensitivity or specificy in the sample is 100%.  Note that this does not perform the test on nested models--for that, see epicalc::lrtest.
