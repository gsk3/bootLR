Description: This package computes appropriate confidence intervals for the likelihood ratio tests commonly used in medicine/epidemiology.  It is particularly useful when the sensitivity or specificy in the sample is 100%.  Note that this does not perform the test on nested models--for that, see epicalc::lrtest.
