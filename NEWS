bootLR v1.0 (Release date: 2015-07-10)
=================

Changes:

* Many minor fixes
* Replaced a grid search with a direct application of the binomial distribution, yielding marked speed improvements
* Reduced the number of bootstrap replicates to 10,000 (from 50k), but added an outer loop to average 50 bootstrap estimations, yielding speed reductions but more stable estimates.
* This is the initial full release, and coincides with the release of the corresponding methodological paper in SMMR: http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0962280215592907
